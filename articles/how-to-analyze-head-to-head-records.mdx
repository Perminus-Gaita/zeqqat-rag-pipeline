## What Head-to-Head Records Tell You {/*section:what-h2h-tells*/}

Some teams have **psychological blocks** against certain opponents. Liverpool might dominate the league but consistently struggle at Goodison Park. These patterns matter.

## The H2H Analysis Framework {/*section:framework*/}

{/* Context: 4 steps: check last 5 meetings (results, scores, consistency), analyze home/away split, compare recent vs distant histor */}

### Step 1: Check Last 5 Meetings
**What to look for:**
- Results (Home/Away/Neutral)
- Score patterns (high-scoring? tight? one-sided?)
- Consistency (same result repeatedly?)

**Example:**
```
Man City vs Tottenham (Last 5)
1. Man City 3-2 Tottenham (Home)
2. Tottenham 0-1 Man City (Away)
3. Man City 4-2 Tottenham (Home)
4. Tottenham 1-3 Man City (Away)
5. Man City 3-1 Tottenham (Home)
```

**Pattern:** Man City dominates (5/5 wins), consistently scores 3-4 goals.

---

### Step 2: Home/Away Split
**Break down by venue:**

**Man City HOME vs Tottenham:**
- Last 3: City wins (3-2, 4-2, 3-1)
- Pattern: City always wins at home vs Spurs

**Tottenham HOME vs Man City:**
- Last 2: City wins (1-0, 3-1)
- Pattern: Even away, City dominates

**Takeaway:** Strong home/away H2H advantage for Man City everywhere.

---

### Step 3: Recent vs Distant History
**When to weight recent meetings more:**
- Manager changes (Spurs hired new manager 6 months ago)
- Squad overhaul (8+ new players since last meeting)
- Tactical shift (team now plays different formation)

**When distant history matters:**
- Consistent psychological pattern (e.g., Everton ALWAYS struggles vs Liverpool regardless of form)
- Derby matches (emotions override form/tactics)
- Specific venue dominance (Anfield, Old Trafford home records)

---

### Step 4: Goal Patterns
**What to check:**
- Average goals per meeting
- Both teams scoring (BTTS) frequency
- Clean sheet patterns

**Example:**
```
Arsenal vs Chelsea (Last 5)
Goals: 3, 2, 4, 3, 2 (avg 2.8 goals/game)
BTTS: 5/5 games (100%)
```

**Implication:** High-scoring fixture, both teams usually score. Unlikely to be 0-0 or 1-0.

## When H2H Records Are MISLEADING {/*section:misleading*/}

{/* Context: Three red flags: major squad changes (8+ starters changed), manager changes (new tactics break old patterns), league pos */}

### Red Flag 1: Major Squad Changes
If 8+ starters have changed since last meeting, old H2H is less relevant.

**Example:** Tottenham beat Man Utd 3-0 in 2022, but 9 starters have changed. That result doesn't matter much now.

### Red Flag 2: Manager Changes
New manager = new tactics = H2H patterns may break.

**Example:** Chelsea always beat Arsenal under Mourinho. New manager? Old pattern less reliable.

### Red Flag 3: League Position Shifts
Team relegated then promoted = different squad/quality. H2H from 3 years ago isn't useful.

## H2H vs Current Form: The Decision Matrix {/*section:decision-matrix*/}

{/* Context: H2H matters more in derbies, 10+ meeting consistent patterns, tactical mismatches. Current form matters more with new ma */}

| Situation | What Matters More? |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Derby match (Everton vs Liverpool) | **H2H** (emotions > form) |
| New manager for one team | **Current Form** |
| 10+ meetings, consistent pattern | **H2H** |
| Last meeting was 18+ months ago | **Current Form** |
| Tactical mismatch historically | **H2H** |
| Major squad overhaul | **Current Form** |

## Practical H2H Checklist {/*section:case-study*/}

{/* Context: Practical example showing H2H analysis (home team advantage 3/5 times) combined with current form (Arsenal excellent, Ma */}

**Before making your pick:**
1. ✅ Check last 5 meetings
2. ✅ Note home/away split
3. ✅ Identify goal patterns (high/low scoring)
4. ✅ Check for manager/squad changes
5. ✅ Look for psychological patterns
6. ✅ Weight recent meetings (last 12 months) heavier

**Time needed:** 2 minutes per fixture

## Case Study: Arsenal vs Manchester United

**H2H Last 5:**
- 3-2 Arsenal (H)
- 1-1 Draw (A)
- 3-1 Man Utd (A)
- 2-0 Arsenal (H)
- 1-0 Man Utd (A)

**Pattern:** Home team advantage (3/5 times home team won)

**Current Form:**
- Arsenal: WWWDW (excellent)
- Man Utd: LDLWD (poor)

**Decision:** Back Arsenal at home (H2H + form aligned)

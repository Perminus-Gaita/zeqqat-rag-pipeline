## The Complete Winner Database {/*section:complete-database*/}

{/* Context: Kenya's betting jackpots have created millionaires since 2017. Most comprehensive database of winners across all major p */}

Kenya's betting jackpots have created millionaires since SportPesa launched the first mega jackpot in 2017. This is the most comprehensive database of jackpot winners across all major platforms.

## SportPesa Mega Jackpot Winners (5 Total) {/*section:sportpesa-mega-winners*/}

{/* Context: All 5 Mega winners from 2017-2025 with amounts, dates, and details. */}

### 1. Samuel Abisai — April 2017 — KSh 221.3M
The first-ever Mega Jackpot winner. Clinical officer from Kakamega. Read his full story in our [winners analysis](/i/sportpesa-jackpot-winners-picks).

### 2. Shared Win (Rono/Keitany/Machogu) — May 2017 — KSh 111.2M
Three winners split the jackpot, each receiving approximately KSh 37 million.

### 3. Gordon Ogada — February 2018 — KSh 230.7M
Motorcycle taxi driver from Siaya. Single KSh 99 entry. Learn from his [winning slip analysis](/i/sportpesa-jackpot-winners-picks).

### 4. Cosmas Korir — September 2018 — KSh 208.7M
University student who played consistently for 2 years before winning.

### 5. Bonnie Kamau — August 3, 2025 — KSh 424.6M **[RECORD]**
**The largest jackpot win in Kenya history.** Transport logistics operator from Ol-Kalou. 10-year bettor. Placed 5 entries totaling KSh 500.

**Tax Impact:** Under Finance Act 2025 (effective July 1, 2025), Bonnie paid approximately **KSh 21.2 million in withdrawal tax (5%)**, down from the KSh 85 million he would have paid under the old 20% regime.

**7-Year Gap:** Note the gap from September 2018 to August 2025 with zero Mega Jackpot winners. This illustrates the difficulty of winning.

## Betika Grand Jackpot Winners {/*section:bonus-tier-winners*/}

{/* Context: Hundreds win bonus tiers weekly. Example week: 0 people 17/17, 8 people 16/17 (KSh 120K), 47 people 15/17 (KSh 25K), 203 */}

### 1. Eli Kipruto Rotich — 2022 — KSh 200M
First Betika Grand Jackpot winner (17 games).

### 2. Moses Kiprono — 2023 — KSh 200M
Second Grand Jackpot winner.

### 3. Nicholas Nguku — 2024 — KSh 15M
Midweek Jackpot winner (15 games).

**Betika "Must Be Won" Feature:** Launched late 2025, this guarantees a winner within 8 weeks. If no one hits 17/17 by week 8, the person with the most correct predictions wins the full jackpot.

## Odibets Laki Tatu Winners (Daily Jackpot) {/*section:kenya-vs-global*/}

{/* Context: Kenya jackpots are globally competitive. SportPesa KSh 100-500M vs UK Lotto £2-10M (1 in 45M), Powerball $100M-1B (1 in  */}

Odibets runs a **daily 10-game jackpot** at KSh 15. While individual prizes are smaller (KSh 500K-2M), there are more winners due to easier odds.

**2025 Notable Winners:**
- Multiple daily winners with prizes ranging KSh 500K-1.5M
- Total paid out: Over KSh 30M in 2025 alone

## Shabiki Jackpot Mbao Winners {/*section:how-to-join*/}

{/* Context: Play consistently (3-5 years average), study patterns, use tools (Draw Counter, Odds Calculator), target 2-5 draws, budg */}

Shabiki's 17-game jackpot at KSh 20 has produced several winners, though exact figures are less publicized than SportPesa/Betika.

## BetLion Goliath Jackpot {/*section:platform-comparison*/}

{/* Context: Table: SportPesa Mega 5 winners in 9 years, Midweek 8+/year, Betika 3+ total, Odibets daily, BetLion never won. */}

The **20-game Goliath** jackpot (KSh 100 entry, KSh 350M prize) is the hardest jackpot in Kenya. As of February 2026, it has **never been won** — the prize pool continues to grow.

## Tax Changes: Finance Act 2025

Prior to July 1, 2025, jackpot winners paid **20% withholding tax on net winnings**. Under the new regime:

**Old System (pre-July 2025):**
- 20% tax on (winnings - stake)
- Example: KSh 100M win = KSh 20M tax

**New System (post-July 2025):**
- 5% tax on ALL withdrawals from betting wallet
- Example: KSh 100M win = approximately KSh 5M tax (if withdrawn in full)

**Why "approximately"?** The 5% tax applies to each withdrawal, not just winnings. If you deposit KSh 10K, win KSh 100M, and withdraw the full KSh 100.01M, you pay 5% on the entire amount.

## Winner Demographics: What the Data Shows

Our analysis of all jackpot winners reveals interesting patterns:

**Age:**
- Average age: 28-35 years
- Youngest: 22 (university student)
- Oldest: 48 (transport operator)

**Betting Experience:**
- Average: 3-5 years before first win
- Longest: 10 years (Bonnie Kamau)
- Shortest: 8 months (Gordon Ogada)

**Entry Cost:**
- Most winners: Single entry (KSh 99) or 2-3 entries (KSh 198-297)
- Exception: Bonnie placed 5 entries (KSh 500)

**Location:**
- Winners come from all parts of Kenya (Kakamega, Siaya, Nyandarua, Nairobi, Mombasa, etc.)
- No geographic advantage

**Occupation:**
- Wide range: students, taxi drivers, office workers, logistics operators
- No professional gambling background

**Key Insight:** Winners are ordinary Kenyans who play consistently within their budget. They're not professional bettors with secret systems.

## The Bonus Tier Winners (The Forgotten Millionaires)

While everyone focuses on jackpot winners, **hundreds of people win bonus tiers (14-16/17 correct) every week**. These payouts range from KSh 10K to KSh 200K+.

**Example: SportPesa Mega Jackpot Week (January 2026)**
- 0 people: 17/17 (jackpot rolls over)
- 8 people: 16/17 (KSh 120K each)
- 47 people: 15/17 (KSh 25K each)
- 203 people: 14/17 (KSh 5K each)

Over a year, bonus tier winners collectively earn **more money than jackpot winners**. Learn more about [bonus structures](/i/midweek-mega-jackpot-predictions).

## Comparison: Kenya vs Global Jackpots

**Kenya Jackpots:**
- SportPesa Mega: KSh 100M-500M
- Betika Grand: KSh 100M-300M
- Odds: 1 in 129M (17 games)

**Global Comparisons:**
- UK Lotto: £2M-10M (1 in 45M odds)
- Powerball (US): $100M-1B (1 in 292M odds)
- EuroMillions: €17M-200M (1 in 140M odds)

Kenya's jackpots are competitive globally, especially considering the lower entry cost (KSh 99 vs £2 or $2).

## How to Join the Winners List

1. **Play consistently** — Average winner plays 3-5 years
2. **Study patterns** — Read our [winners analysis guide](/i/sportpesa-jackpot-winners-picks)

## Platform Comparison

Choosing the right platform affects your chances:

| Platform | Games | Entry Cost | Prize Pool | Winners | Frequency |
|----------|-------|------------|------------|---------|-----------|
| SportPesa Mega | 17 | KSh 99 | KSh 100M+ | 5 (2017-2025) | Once every 1-2 years |
| SportPesa Midweek | 13 | KSh 99 | KSh 10-20M | 8+ (2025) | Monthly |
| Betika Grand | 17 | KSh 49-99 | KSh 100-300M | 3+ | Yearly |
| Odibets Laki Tatu | 10 | KSh 15 | KSh 500K-2M | Daily | Daily |
| BetLion Goliath | 20 | KSh 100 | KSh 350M+ | 0 | Never won |

## The Bottom Line

**Kenya has created only 5 Mega Jackpot millionaires in 9 years.** The odds are brutal. But:

- Midweek jackpots produce winners monthly
- Bonus tiers pay out weekly
- Daily jackpots (Odibets) create winners every day

Your goal shouldn't be "win the Mega Jackpot." It should be "consistently hit 14-16/17 correct and win bonus tiers." Over time, this is far more profitable than chasing the grand prize.

**And who knows?** That one week where you nail 17/17 might be the week you join the list.

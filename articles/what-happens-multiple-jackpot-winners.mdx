## Prize Sharing Rules {/*section:sharing-rules*/}

{/* Context: If multiple people get 17/17 correct, jackpot is split equally. Example: KSh 200M ÷ 4 winners = KSh 50M each (before tax */}

If multiple people get 17/17 correct, the jackpot is **split equally**.

**Example:**
- Jackpot: KSh 200M
- Winners: 4 people
- Each receives: KSh 50M (before tax)

## Historical Split Wins {/*section:historical-splits*/}

{/* Context: May 2017: 3 winners split KSh 111.2M (~KSh 37M each). Only time in SportPesa history that Mega Jackpot was split. */}

**May 2017:** 3 winners split KSh 111.2M
- Each received: ~KSh 37M

This is the only time in SportPesa history that the Mega Jackpot was split.

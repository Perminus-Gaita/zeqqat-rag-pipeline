## You Just Won the Jackpot. Now What? {/*section:you-just-won*/}

{/* Context: 80% of lottery winners go broke within 5 years. This guide prevents that. Use the calculator to plan finances before cla */}

Winning a multi-million shilling jackpot is life-changing. But **80% of lottery winners go broke within 5 years**. This guide ensures you don't become that statistic.

Use the calculator above to plan your post-win finances before claiming the money.

## Step 1: Don't Tell Anyone (Yet) {/*section:first-90-days*/}

{/* Context: Days 1-7: verify, screenshot, tell only spouse, don't post on social media. Days 8-30: hire tax advisor, financial plann */}

**The #1 mistake winners make:** Announcing their win publicly before having a plan.

**Why this matters:**
- Friends and family will ask for money (sometimes demanding it)
- Scammers target known winners
- You'll make emotional decisions under social pressure

**What to do instead:**
1. Take a screenshot of your winning slip
2. Tell only your spouse/partner (if you have one)
3. Wait 72 hours before telling anyone else
4. Use that time to make a plan

## Step 2: Understand the Tax {/*section:bonnie-example*/}

{/* Context: After 5% tax (KSh 403.4M): 50% preservation (KSh 201.7M in real estate, bonds, stocks = KSh 2-2.7M monthly passive incom */}

Under Kenya's **Finance Act 2025** (effective July 1, 2025), taxation changed significantly:

### Old System (Pre-July 2025)
- **20% withholding tax on net winnings**
- Example: Win KSh 100M, pay KSh 20M tax
- Tax withheld automatically before payout

### New System (Post-July 2025)
- **5% withholding tax on ALL withdrawals from betting wallet**
- Example: Win KSh 100M, pay approximately KSh 5M when you withdraw
- Lower rate, but applies to entire withdrawal (including your original stake)

**Important nuance:** If you deposit KSh 10,000, win KSh 100M, and withdraw the full KSh 100.01M, you pay 5% on KSh 100.01M (not just KSh 100M).

### Tax Calculation Examples

**Scenario A: Bonnie Kamau (KSh 424.6M win)**
- Total win: KSh 424,600,000
- Approximate withdrawal tax (5%): **KSh 21,230,000**
- Net amount: **KSh 403,370,000**

**Scenario B: Mid-size win (KSh 50M)**
- Total win: KSh 50,000,000
- Approximate withdrawal tax (5%): **KSh 2,500,000**
- Net amount: **KSh 47,500,000**

**Scenario C: Midweek Jackpot (KSh 15M)**
- Total win: KSh 15,000,000
- Approximate withdrawal tax (5%): **KSh 750,000**
- Net amount: **KSh 14,250,000**

## Step 3: The 50/30/20 Investment Rule

Financial advisors recommend this split for sudden wealth:

### 50% — Wealth Preservation (Long-Term Security)
**Goal:** Never work again

**Allocate to:**
- **Real estate (30%)** — Rental properties in Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru
- **Government bonds (10%)** — Treasury bills and bonds (8-12% annual return)
- **Blue-chip stocks (10%)** — Safaricom, KCB, Equity Bank on NSE

**Example (KSh 100M win):**
- KSh 50M to preservation
  - KSh 30M: Buy 3-4 rental properties → KSh 200K-400K monthly rent
  - KSh 10M: Treasury bonds → KSh 80K-100K monthly interest
  - KSh 10M: NSE blue chips → KSh 50K-80K monthly dividends

**Monthly passive income: KSh 330K-580K** (without touching principal)

### 30% — Business & Growth (Wealth Building)
**Goal:** Grow your money faster

**Allocate to:**
- **Start a business (15%)** — Import/export, logistics, hospitality, agribusiness
- **High-yield investments (10%)** — SACCOs, money market funds
- **Education & Skills (5%)** — Courses, certifications, business training

**Example (KSh 100M win):**
- KSh 30M to growth
  - KSh 15M: Start a matatu SACCO or logistics company
  - KSh 10M: High-yield SACCOs (12-15% returns)
  - KSh 5M: Business education and skills development

### 20% — Lifestyle & Giving (Enjoy Now)
**Goal:** Enjoy your win responsibly

**Allocate to:**
- **Dream purchases (10%)** — House, car, family needs
- **Emergency fund (5%)** — 6-12 months expenses in savings
- **Family & charity (5%)** — Help close family, give to community

**Example (KSh 100M win):**
- KSh 20M to lifestyle
  - KSh 10M: Buy a home or upgrade housing
  - KSh 5M: Emergency fund (liquid savings)
  - KSh 5M: Family support and charitable giving

## Step 4: The Fatal Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake #1: Quitting Your Job Immediately
**Why it's fatal:** No structure, no purpose, no income discipline

**Better approach:**
- Keep working for 6-12 months while your investments generate passive income
- Use the time to plan your next chapter
- Quit only when passive income exceeds your salary by 2×

### Mistake #2: Buying Flashy Depreciating Assets
**Examples of bad purchases:**
- Brand new Range Rover (loses 30% value in year 1)
- Designer clothes and watches
- Expensive vacations to Dubai/Europe

**Why it's fatal:** These don't generate income. They drain wealth.

**Better approach:**
- Buy **income-generating assets first** (rental properties, businesses)
- After passive income is established, reward yourself with 10% of MONTHLY passive income (not the lump sum)

### Mistake #3: Lending Money to Everyone
**The reality:** Friends and family will ask for money. Some will demand it.

**Why it's fatal:**
- You can't say yes to everyone
- People who receive free money don't appreciate it
- Resentment builds when you eventually say no

**Better approach:**
- Set a fixed "giving budget" (5% of total winnings)
- Help with education, medical emergencies, or business capital (not cash handouts)
- Say: "I've allocated a fixed amount for family support. Here's what I can do for you."

### Mistake #4: Trusting the Wrong People
**The scam:** "Invest in my can't-miss business opportunity"

**Why it's fatal:** Winners attract con artists promising 20-30% monthly returns. These are Ponzi schemes.

**Better approach:**
- Only work with licensed financial advisors
- Verify all investment opportunities with independent lawyers
- If it sounds too good to be true, it is

### Mistake #5: Not Hiring Professionals
**Trying to manage KSh 100M yourself is like trying to perform surgery on yourself.**

**Hire these people IMMEDIATELY:**
- **Tax advisor** — Optimize your tax situation
- **Financial planner** — Create your 50/30/20 allocation
- **Lawyer** — Review contracts, draft family agreements
- **Accountant** — Manage monthly cash flow and reporting

**Cost:** KSh 500K-1M per year
**Value:** Saves you KSh 5M-10M+ in mistakes

## Step 5: Protect Your Wealth Long-Term

### Set Up a Trust or Foundation
For wins above KSh 50M, consider setting up a family trust or private foundation. Benefits:
- Protects assets from frivolous lawsuits
- Manages family wealth across generations
- Tax optimization
- Prevents family disputes after your death

**Consult a lawyer experienced in estate planning.**

### Create a Will Immediately
Without a will, Kenya's succession laws dictate how your wealth is distributed (often not how you'd want).

**Include:**
- Asset distribution (who gets what)
- Guardianship for minor children
- Trust management instructions
- Charitable bequests

### Get Proper Insurance
**Life insurance:** If you die, your family still receives income

**Asset insurance:** Protect rental properties, businesses, vehicles

**Health insurance:** Comprehensive cover for your family

## Step 6: Your First 90 Days Action Plan

### Days 1-7: Verification & Planning
- Verify winning slip with SportPesa/Betika
- Screenshot everything
- Tell only spouse/partner
- Do NOT post on social media
- Start creating your plan

### Days 8-30: Assemble Your Team
- Hire tax advisor
- Hire financial planner
- Hire lawyer
- Open separate bank accounts for different purposes
- Calculate exact tax liability

### Days 31-60: Initial Allocation
- Claim your winnings
- Pay taxes
- Allocate funds: 50% preservation, 30% growth, 20% lifestyle
- Make first investments (real estate, bonds)
- Set up emergency fund

### Days 61-90: Long-Term Setup
- Establish trust/foundation (if applicable)
- Draft will
- Purchase insurance
- Start business ventures (if planned)
- Set up passive income tracking

## Real Winner Example: How Bonnie Kamau Should Allocate KSh 424.6M

**After 5% tax:** KSh 403.4M

### 50% Preservation (KSh 201.7M)
- **Real estate (KSh 121M):** 10-15 rental properties → KSh 1.5M-2M monthly rent
- **Government bonds (KSh 40M):** → KSh 320K-400K monthly interest
- **NSE blue chips (KSh 40M):** → KSh 200K-300K monthly dividends

**Total passive income: KSh 2M-2.7M monthly**

### 30% Growth (KSh 121M)
- **Transport business (KSh 60M):** Expand his logistics company
- **SACCOs/money market (KSh 50M):** High-yield investments
- **Education (KSh 11M):** Business courses, family education

### 20% Lifestyle (KSh 80M)
- **New home (KSh 40M):** Buy/build dream house
- **Emergency fund (KSh 20M):** Liquid savings
- **Family/charity (KSh 20M):** Support extended family, community projects

## Our Review Methodology {/*section:methodology*/}

{/* Context: Evaluation criteria: prize pools & payouts (30%), odds & difficulty (25%), app & UX quality (20%), customer support (15% */}

We evaluate platforms on:
1. **Prize pools & payouts** (30%)
2. **Odds & difficulty** (25%)
3. **App & UX quality** (20%)
4. **Customer support** (15%)
5. **Bonus features** (10%)

All platforms reviewed are BCLB-licensed.

## Detailed Platform Reviews {/*section:sportpesa-review*/}

{/* Context: Gold standard. Pros: largest prizes (KSh 424.6M record), 5 winners, excellent bonus tiers, best app. Cons: extremely dif */}

### SportPesa ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4.8/5)

**Overall:** The gold standard for jackpot betting in Kenya.

**Pros:**
✅ Largest prizes (KSh 424.6M record)
✅ Proven track record (5 Mega winners)
✅ Excellent bonus tiers
✅ Best mobile app
✅ Reliable payouts

**Cons:**
❌ Mega Jackpot extremely difficult
❌ Higher entry costs than competitors
❌ Can go months without Mega winners

**Best for:** Serious bettors targeting life-changing money

**Our verdict:** If you're going to play one jackpot, make it SportPesa. The Midweek Jackpot offers the best balance of odds and prize size.

### Betika ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4.5/5)

**Overall:** Strong alternative with innovation.

**Pros:**
✅ "Must Be Won" feature (winner guaranteed every 8 weeks)
✅ Multiple jackpot types
✅ Lower entry costs
✅ Good mobile experience
✅ Strong customer service

**Cons:**
❌ Smaller prize pools than SportPesa
❌ Less historical data
❌ Fewer Mega winners overall

**Best for:** Bettors who want more frequent winner announcements

**Our verdict:** The "Must Be Won" feature is game-changing. By week 8, someone MUST win even if no one hits 17/17. Smart innovation.

---

### Odibets ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4.2/5)

**Overall:** Best for daily action.

**Pros:**
✅ Daily jackpot (10 games)
✅ Best odds (1 in 59,000)
✅ Very affordable (KSh 15)
✅ Consistent winners
✅ Lightweight app (2.8MB)

**Cons:**
❌ Smaller prizes (max KSh 2M)
❌ Less prestige than SportPesa/Betika
❌ Fewer features

**Best for:** Beginners or those wanting regular small wins

**Our verdict:** If you want to win SOMETHING regularly rather than chase rare mega prizes, Odibets delivers. Daily winners create more realistic expectations.

---

### Shabiki ⭐⭐⭐ (3.8/5)

**Overall:** Budget option with limited track record.

**Pros:**
✅ Cheapest entry (KSh 20)
✅ BCLB licensed
✅ Decent prize pools

**Cons:**
❌ Few documented winners
❌ Less marketing/visibility
❌ Smaller user base
❌ App quality below competitors

**Best for:** Budget-conscious bettors

**Our verdict:** Legitimate but unproven. The KSh 20 entry is attractive, but lack of winner announcements raises questions about frequency.

---

### BetLion ⭐⭐⭐ (3.5/5)

**Overall:** High-risk lottery gamble.

**Pros:**
✅ Largest prize pool (KSh 350M+)
✅ Growing jackpot
✅ Licensed platform

**Cons:**
❌ Never been won (1 in 3.5 billion odds)
❌ 20 games is too difficult
❌ Higher entry cost (KSh 100)
❌ No winner track record

**Best for:** Those who want extreme lottery-style difficulty

**Our verdict:** Mathematically, this is nearly impossible. The 20-game format has never produced a winner. Better to play two SportPesa Midweek entries for the same KSh 100.

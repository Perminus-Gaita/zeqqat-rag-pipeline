## When Matches Get Postponed {/*section:when-postponed*/}

{/* Context: Weather, COVID, stadium issues, or security concerns can postpone matches. Rules vary by number of postponements. */}

Weather, COVID, stadium issues, or security concerns can postpone matches. Here's what happens to your jackpot bet.

## SportPesa's Official Policy {/*section:official-policy*/}

{/* Context: 1-3 postponed: jackpot continues, voided matches removed, predict remaining only. 4+ postponed: entire jackpot cancelled */}

**If 1-3 matches are postponed:**
- Jackpot continues
- Postponed matches are **voided**
- You only need to predict remaining matches correctly

**If 4+ matches are postponed:**
- Entire jackpot is **cancelled**
- All entries are **refunded** to your account
- Prize pool rolls over to next week

## How Voided Matches Affect Odds {/*section:odds-impact*/}

{/* Context: 2 matches postponed: 15 games remain, odds drop from 129M to 14.3M — 9x improvement automatically. 5+ postponed: jackpot */}

**Example: 17-game Mega Jackpot**

**Scenario 1: 2 matches postponed**
- Remaining games: 15
- New odds: 3^15 = 14,348,907 (vs original 129M)
- **Your odds improve 9× automatically!**

**Scenario 2: 5 matches postponed**
- Jackpot cancelled
- Full refund issued

## What Counts as "Postponed" {/*section:what-counts*/}

{/* Context: Postponed: match moved to different date, cancelled before kickoff, severe weather, stadium safety. NOT postponed: aband */}

**Postponement triggers:**
✅ Match moved to different date
✅ Match cancelled before kickoff
✅ Severe weather preventing play
✅ Stadium safety issues

**NOT postponements:**
❌ Match abandoned after 70+ minutes (result stands based on score at abandonment)
❌ Match delayed by 30-60 minutes (still plays same day)

## Refund Timeline {/*section:refund-timeline*/}

{/* Context: Before deadline: immediate refund. After deadline: within 24 hours. KSh 99 returned to SportPesa account. */}

**When you get refunded:**
- Postponements announced before jackpot deadline: **Immediate refund**
- Postponements announced after deadline: **Refund within 24 hours**

**How refund works:**
- KSh 99 returned to your SportPesa account
- Available immediately for re-betting
- Can withdraw to M-Pesa if desired

## Strategic Considerations {/*section:strategic-considerations*/}

{/* Context: Postponement weeks can improve odds. 2 of 5 Mega winners won during weeks with 1-2 postponed matches. Fewer games = bett */}

### Should You Bet If Postponements Are Likely?

**Consider postponing your bet if:**
- Bad weather forecast for multiple match locations
- COVID outbreak rumors at multiple clubs
- Political instability in match locations

**Still bet if:**
- Only 1-2 matches at risk (improves your odds)
- Jackpot prize pool is unusually high
- You're confident in remaining fixtures

- Total jackpots: ~450
